    <h1>Brownies</h1>

    <p>I don't know why people don't make Birthday Brownies all the time — they're so easy and so wonderful. Brownies are much quicker to make than a cake, and they look so beautiful piled up in a rough-and-tumble pyramid spiked with birthday candles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Makes: maximum of 48</p>
    <ul>
        <li>375 grams soft unsalted butter</li>
        <li>375 grams best-quality dark chocolate</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>500 grams caster sugar</li>
        <li>225 grams plain flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>300 grams chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/160°C Fan/350°F/gas mark 4. Line your brownie pan — I think it's worth lining the sides as well as the base — with foil, parchment or Bake-O-Glide.</li>        
        <li>Melt the butter and chocolate together in a large heavy-based pan. In a bowl or large wide-mouthed measuring jug, beat the eggs with the sugar and vanilla. Measure the flour into another bowl and add the salt.</li>
        <li>When the chocolate mixture has melted, let it cool a bit before beating in the eggs and sugar, and then the nuts and flour. Beat to combine smoothly and then scrape out of the saucepan into the lined pan.
        </li>
        <li>With a spoon or spatula, fold in the chocolate chips and pumpkin seeds; you will have a thick, firm mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 25 minutes. When it's ready, the top should be dried to a paler brown speckle, but the middle still dark and dense and gooey. And even with such a big batch you do need to keep alert, keep checking: the difference between gungy brownies and dry brownies is only a few minutes; remember that they will continue to cook as they cool.</li>
    </ol>
